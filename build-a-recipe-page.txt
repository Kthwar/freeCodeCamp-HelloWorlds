    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Put water on the pot, enough to make sure the pasta will be fully submerged.</li>
      <li>Put salt on the water, just enough, you know it's good once it tastes like seawater. (If you don't know the taste, that's okay, a common mistake is to put salt and it tastes a bit "sweet", if that's your case, put more salt, when the "sweetness" disappears, you're golden.</li>
      <li>Bring the water to a boil (boiling means some large bubbles, but not enough to be scary looking.)</li>
      <li>Break the pasta, grap the ammount of pasta you want to use, and snap it in half. Be careful as it will jump!</li>
      <li>Read the instructions for the pasta, and set a timer accordingly, most pasta is 8 minutes for "al dente" (arguably the est texture)</li>
      <li>Put the pasta on the boiling water and bring the heat down a little, you don't want the water getting hotter, only keep it roughly the same temperature.</li>
      <li>From time to time move the pasta with a fork so they don't stick together</li>
